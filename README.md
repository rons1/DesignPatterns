# DesignPatterns
Course

## 1 - Singleton
- Useful when you want to create only one unstance of object from a class

## 2 - Factory
- Faunction that generate and returns an object from the specified class
## 3 - State
- An imlementation to a state machine

## 4 - Chain Of Responsibility
- A set of objects that can pass a process throght a flow
- Each object is handling only one step
- The order of the steps is 

## 5 - Composite
- An implementation to containers and objects inside them
- An implementation to trees, subtrees and leaves

## 6 - Prototype
- Maked a deep Clone to an object

## 7 - Visitor
- To combine an existing functionallity to many classes
- To Add a new functionallity to many classes
- Disadvantage: You will always have to update the IVisitor after you add new class
- All the logic is implemented in the Visitor Class

## 8 - Adapter
- Useful for an old code
- Can be useful for a third party code

## 9 - Memento
- Remineds Undo and Redo
- You can save a state and return to it when you decide

## 10 - TemplateMethod
- Useful for code reuse
- Useful for running same code with minor changes each time
- Useful when set of functions run every time

## 11 - Strategy
- When you want to use Has-A instead of Is-A

## 12 - Decorator
- When you want to modify an object many times, every time modify the most updated object
